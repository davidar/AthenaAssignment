# Athena Assignment

## Setup

This project uses assets from [the free "Rural Australia" asset pack available from the UE marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/20b8034d9089454fa8c6dce313f89177). As it is several gigabytes in size, I haven't uploaded it to this repo, so please use the Epic Launcher to add it to the project: click "Add To Project", check "Show all projects", and select version "5.0" (or otherwise copy the `RuralAustralia` Content folder into this project).
